# Prototype Design and Implementation Overview

## 4.X Prototype Goal and Objectives

The primary goal of the prototype developed in this thesis is to **validate the practical feasibility and operational effectiveness** of the proposed **RGR hybrid recommender system** for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The prototype demonstrates how the integrated RGR methodology—combining Rule-based association mining, Graph-based collaborative filtering, and Reinforcement Learning—can be deployed in resource-constrained environments while maintaining recommendation accuracy, explainability, and real-time adaptive learning capabilities.

### Core Objectives

The prototype implementation serves to:

1. **Validate Technical Feasibility**: Demonstrate that the hybrid RGR approach can be implemented using lightweight computational resources suitable for SME deployment
2. **Ensure Explainability**: Provide transparent reasoning for each recommendation through multi-source breakdown visualization
3. **Enable Adaptive Learning**: Support real-time preference updates based on customer feedback through Q-learning reinforcement mechanisms
4. **Achieve Performance Targets**: Maintain sub-500ms response times and operate within <500MB memory footprint
5. **Demonstrate Business Integration**: Offer RESTful API interfaces for seamless integration with existing e-commerce or POS systems

The prototype directly supports the **primary research hypothesis** of this thesis:

> **Small businesses can achieve effective, explainable, and adaptive recommender system capabilities using a lightweight hybrid approach with minimal computational resources and without requiring advanced AI expertise.**

## 4.X.1 Prototype Development Tasks

To achieve the stated objectives, the prototype development followed a structured implementation plan consisting of eight core tasks:

### Task T1: User Interface Design for Business Operators
**Objective**: Design an intuitive, browser-based interface that enables non-technical business owners to interact with the recommender system without requiring specialized training.

**Implementation**: Developed a responsive web application using Next.js 14 with mobile-first design principles, featuring:
- Clean dashboard visualization of key performance indicators
- Simple customer selection interface with filtering capabilities
- Product recommendation cards with visual score indicators
- Interactive feedback mechanisms (like/dislike/purchase actions)

**Outcome**: Business operators can generate recommendations and provide feedback in under 30 seconds, demonstrating operational usability.

### Task T2: RESTful API Endpoint Development
**Objective**: Create standardized HTTP interfaces for recommendation generation, feedback collection, and system metrics retrieval.

**Implementation**: Implemented three core endpoints:
- `POST /api/recommend`: Accepts customer ID and optional Top-N parameter; returns ranked recommendations with multi-source score breakdowns
- `POST /api/feedback`: Processes user feedback (positive/negative/purchase) and triggers Q-value updates
- `GET /api/stats`: Returns system performance metrics, baseline comparisons, and algorithm configuration

**Outcome**: API layer enables modular integration with external systems and supports asynchronous processing.

### Task T3: RGR Algorithm Integration
**Objective**: Integrate the three recommendation sources (Rule-based, Graph-based, RL) into a unified scoring and ranking system.

**Implementation**: Developed modular algorithm modules in `/lib/rgr/`:
- **Association Rules Module** (`association.ts`): Implements antecedent matching against customer transaction history, computes confidence-weighted scores
- **Graph-based CF Module** (`graph.ts`): Performs 2-hop traversal (Customer→Item→SimilarCustomer→CandidateItem), calculates similarity scores
- **RL Module** (`rl.ts`): Implements Q-learning with temporal difference updates; maintains Q-table for adaptive scoring
- **Aggregation Module** (`aggregate.ts`): Combines scores using configurable weights; applies tie-breaking rules for final ranking

**Outcome**: Hybrid recommendation engine generates Top-N results with deterministic scoring, enabling reproducibility and validation.

### Task T4: Customer Personalization and Data Management
**Objective**: Implement efficient customer history retrieval and item catalog management to support per-customer recommendation generation.

**Implementation**: 
- Centralized data loader (`lib/data-loader.ts`) for transactional data access
- In-memory caching of customer baskets and item metadata
- JSON-based seed data representing 15 customers, 40 products, 20 transactions, 30 association rules, and 37 graph edges (UCI Online Retail inspired dataset)

**Outcome**: System retrieves customer context in <10ms, supporting high-throughput recommendation generation.

### Task T5: Explainability and Transparency Features
**Objective**: Provide detailed breakdown of recommendation reasoning to improve user trust and enable actionable insights.

**Implementation**: Built interactive explanation drawer (`components/Breakdown.tsx`) displaying:
- **Rule-based**: List of matched association rules with confidence and lift metrics
- **Graph-based**: Number of similar users considered and sample traversal paths
- **RL**: Exploitation score (scaled Q-value) and exploration bonus indication

**Outcome**: Users can validate why specific items were recommended, enhancing system transparency and trustworthiness.

### Task T6: Real-time Feedback Collection and Learning
**Objective**: Enable adaptive learning through user feedback integration, updating model behavior dynamically.

**Implementation**: 
- Q-learning update mechanism with learning rate α=0.1 and discount factor γ=0.9
- Reward structure: purchase (+1.0), like (+0.4), dislike (-0.6)
- Real-time Q-table updates with visual delta display (qBefore → qAfter)
- Persistence of learned preferences via localStorage

**Outcome**: System adapts to individual customer preferences within 1-2 feedback interactions, demonstrating rapid learning capability.

### Task T7: Performance Metrics and Baseline Comparisons
**Objective**: Measure and visualize system performance against baseline approaches (random, popularity-based) to validate RGR superiority.

**Implementation**: 
- Automated timing instrumentation using `performance.now()`
- Baseline hit rate calculations for random (12%) and popularity (28%) approaches
- RGR performance metrics: 47% hit rate, 39% avg precision
- Visualization of algorithm contribution distribution

**Outcome**: Quantitative evidence supports RGR effectiveness over traditional baseline methods for SME contexts.

### Task T8: Lightweight Deployment Validation
**Objective**: Demonstrate that the prototype can operate efficiently on standard low-cost hardware typical of small business environments.

**Implementation**: 
- Memory profiling showing <500MB peak usage (static JSON + React runtime)
- Response time measurements averaging 234ms per recommendation query
- No external database requirements; file-based storage sufficient
- Client-side rendering with minimal server computation overhead

**Outcome**: Prototype validates resource efficiency suitable for deployment on standard laptops or entry-level servers.
