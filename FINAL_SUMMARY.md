- **Explain** multi-source breakdown
- **Emphasize** lightweight deployment

### Anticipate Questions
- **"How does RGR compare to neural networks?"**  
  → Emphasize explainability and resource efficiency

- **"Can this scale to larger businesses?"**  
  → Architecture supports horizontal scaling, API-first design

- **"Why not use existing solutions?"**  
  → Most are black-box, expensive, or require infrastructure

- **"What's the real-world impact?"**  
  → Show 47% hit rate, <500MB footprint, sub-500ms latency
