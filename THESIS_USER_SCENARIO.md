# User Scenario and Demonstration Walkthrough

## 4.Y User Scenario: Small Business Recommendation Workflow

### Scenario Context

**Actor**: Aysel, shop owner of "Rose Perfume Boutique"  
**Objective**: Provide personalized product recommendations to her loyal customer "Aysel" (Customer ID: c001)  
**Context**: Customer "Aysel" has previously purchased Rose Perfume 50ml and Air Fresheners. Aysel wants to suggest complementary items to increase the average order value.

---

### Step-by-Step Demonstration

#### Step 1: System Authentication
**Action**: Aysel navigates to the RGR-RECO web interface and enters her email address.

**System Response**: 
- Mock authentication successful
- Redirects to dashboard showing system overview
- Displays: 15 customers, 40 products, 20 transactions, 30 association rules

**Rationale**: Lightweight authentication suitable for single-operator businesses; no complex user management required.

---

#### Step 2: Customer Selection
**Action**: Aysel navigates to the "Recommendations" page and selects "Aysel" from the customer dropdown.

**System Response**:
- Dropdown displays 15 customers with metadata (name, country, tags)
- Selection triggers state update in application
- UI indicates ready state for recommendation generation

**Rationale**: Simple customer selection enables targeted recommendation generation without complex customer segmentation rules.

---

#### Step 3: Recommendation Generation
**Action**: Aysel clicks the "Get Recommendations" button.

**System Processing** (occurring in background):
1. **Data Loading** (~10ms): Retrieve customer "Aysel" transaction history
   - Transaction t001: Rose Perfume (i101), Air Freshener (i202)
   - Transaction t004: Rose Perfume (i101), Gift Mug (i301)
   - Transaction t016: Rose Perfume (i101), Air Freshener (i202), Aroma Candle (i302)

2. **Rule-based Scoring** (~45ms):
   - Rule r1 matched: {Rose Perfume} → {Gift Mug} (confidence: 0.52, lift: 1.7)
   - Rule r3 matched: {Rose Perfume, Air Freshener} → {Aroma Candle} (confidence: 0.36, lift: 1.9)
   - Computes rule score: 0.42 (normalized)

3. **Graph-based Scoring** (~78ms):
   - 2-hop traversal: Customer c001 → Item i101 → Similar customers (c002, c006, c007) → Candidate items
   - Identifies similar users who purchased Rose Perfume
   - Computes graph score: 0.38 (normalized)

4. **RL-based Scoring** (~23ms):
   - Retrieves Q-value for (c001, i301): 0.05
   - Computes exploitation score: 0.15 (scaled via sigmoid)
   - Applies exploration bonus: 0.10 for items not in recent history

5. **Aggregation** (~12ms):
   - Final score = 0.42(rule) + 0.38(graph) + 0.15(exploit) + 0.05(explore) = 1.0
   - Sorts by score descending
   - Filters out already-purchased items

**System Response** (after ~234ms total):
- Displays Top-12 ranked recommendations with product cards
- Each card shows: product name, match score (percentage), visual score bars
- Recommendation order (top 3):
  1. **Gift Mug** (Score: 87.3%) - Strong rule match, no recent purchase
  2. **Aroma Candle** (Score: 74.6%) - High lift rule, graph support
  3. **Scent Bag** (Score: 62.1%) - Graph similarity, exploration bonus

**Rationale**: Sub-500ms response time enables real-time recommendation during customer interactions; multi-source scoring ensures diverse and relevant suggestions.

---

#### Step 4: Explainability Inspection
**Action**: Aysel clicks "Why?" on the top recommendation "Gift Mug".

**System Response**: Drawer panel displays complete breakdown:

**Rule-based (42% contribution)**:
- Score: 52% (rule confidence weighted by lift)
- Matched Rules: r1
  - Antecedent: Rose Perfume
  - Consequent: Gift Mug
  - Confidence: 0.52
  - Lift: 1.7 (strong positive correlation)

**Graph-based (38% contribution)**:
- Score: 45%
- Similar Users Considered: 3
  - Via c002 (purchased Rose Perfume)
  - Via c006 (purchased Rose Perfume)
  - Via c007 (purchased Rose Perfume)

**RL-based (20% contribution)**:
- Exploitation Score: 15% (Q-value based)
- Exploration Bonus: 0% (item in recent history)
- Current Q-value: 0.05

**User Insight**: "Ah, Gift Mug is recommended because customers who buy Rose Perfume often purchase it as a gift pairing (lift 1.7), and 3 similar customers have this purchase pattern. This makes sense for my boutique strategy."

**Rationale**: Explainability builds trust and enables shop owners to confidently present recommendations to customers; understanding the reasoning supports upselling conversations.

---

#### Step 5: Feedback Collection
**Action**: Aysel believes "Gift Mug" is a strong recommendation. She clicks the "Like" button.

**System Processing**:
1. Triggers `POST /api/feedback` request
2. RL update: Q(c001, i301) ← Q(0.05) + α(0.1) × (reward(0.4) - Q(0.05))
3. Computes new Q-value: 0.086
4. Stores updated Q-value in localStorage

**System Response**:
- Toast notification: "Positive signal recorded. Q-value increased from 0.05 to 0.086."
- Recommendation card updates to show new Q-value
- Breakdown now displays: "Q-after: 0.086 (was 0.05)"

**Rationale**: Feedback loop enables adaptive learning; positive feedback increases future recommendation likelihood for this item-customer pair, personalizing results over time.

#### Step 6: Performance Metrics Review
**Action**: Aysel navigates to "Metrics" page to review system performance.

**System Response**: Dashboard displays:

**Performance Metrics**:
- Average Response Time: 234ms
- Memory Footprint: 456MB
- Rule Count: 30
- Graph Density: 6.2%

**Baseline Comparisons**:
| Approach | Hit Rate | Avg Precision |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Random | 12% | 8% |
| Popularity-based | 28% | 21% |
| **RGR Hybrid** | **47%** | **39%** |

**Top Rules** (by lift):
1. r12: {Rose Perfume 100ml} → {Gift Set 3pc} (lift: 2.1)
2. r3: {Rose Perfume, Air Freshener} → {Aroma Candle} (lift: 1.9)
3. r1: {Rose Perfume} → {Gift Mug} (lift: 1.7)

**Algorithm Weights** (current configuration):
- Rule-based: 42%
- Graph-based: 38%
- RL Exploitation: 15%
- RL Exploration: 5%

**User Insight**: "The system achieves 47% hit rate compared to 12% random baseline, showing strong performance. The RGR approach is clearly more effective than traditional popularity-based methods for my boutique context."

**Rationale**: Quantitative metrics validate system effectiveness; baseline comparisons provide evidence that RGR hybrid approach outperforms standard recommendation strategies.
